## Next Steps
- Implement an odds API to have real time betting odds for users to reference while entering their bets
- If bet type is a parlay, click on that bet card and see the different legs of the parlay
- AAU, be able to filter the history by day, week, month, year
- If API, AAU, I want to use the data from the API and take advantage of clicking rather than having to input the information
- AAU, click on sport specific buttons that would direct me to only those odds
- If API, see the real time odds compared to the odds that were originally taken
